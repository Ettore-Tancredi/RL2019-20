# Rescue Line Galilei 2018/19
This is the repository where we are developing the _code_ that will guide our robot at the 2019 edition of the Robocup JR in the Rescue Line competition.

## Code styling
Just keep it humane.

## Repo management
Remember to create a build/ directory in src/ for cmake. Remember to call `git pull` before you start working.  

That's pretty much it.
